This is a Predictive Analytics tool for Social Health Insurance. 
Kenyaâ€™s new Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) faces challenges in predicting healthcare costs, leading to inefficiencies in resource allocation, delayed reimbursements, and possible financial strain on the system.  
Fahamubot is a machine learning model, developed on Azure to predict future healthcare costs for insured individuals using historical claims, patient demographics, and disease burden data.
