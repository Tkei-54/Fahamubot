This is a Predictive Analytics tool for Social Health Insurance. 
Kenyaâ€™s new Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) faces challenges in predicting healthcare costs, leading to inefficiencies in resource allocation, delayed reimbursements, and possible financial strain on the system.  
Fahamubot is a machine learning (ML) model, developed on to predict future healthcare costs for insured individuals using historical claims, patient demographics, and disease burden data.  
I obtained a training dataset from kaggle to achieve this. But first, I've had to understand the relationships between the variables and the pricing. This is even before I advance to the ML stage, which i don't know how to execute yet because of knowledge limitations :)
